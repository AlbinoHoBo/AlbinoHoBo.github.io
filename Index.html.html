	<h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
			<!-- I know the book said <p class="myname"> blahblah </p> and it would apply it to that specific block -->
	<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was chosen to be one of the one thousand beta testers for the closed beta of Sword Art Online, the first ever Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG) for the NerveGear, and later joined the official version of the game. I thus became one of the 10,000 players who were trapped in Sword Art Online, where I remained a solo player for the majority of the game, willingly taking on the role of a Beater to reduce discrimination against other former beta testers, as well as actively taking part in Boss battles as one of the Clearers.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Former member of the Moonlit Black Cats after helping them safely escape a dangerous dungeon, but returned to being a solo player when a fatal error resulted in the death of the other guild members.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the aftermath of the incident, I returned with my avatar to ALfheim Online, and continued playing it with my friends. Several months later, I was offered a part-time job to test a new FullDive machine known as the Soul Translator, but unbeknownst to me, I was actually helping with a military project known as Project Alicization. Now im an independent contractor for the highest bidder.</p>
